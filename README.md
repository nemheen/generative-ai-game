# AI-Powered Language Learning Game for Kids

This project is an interactive AI-powered language learning game designed for children, integrating speech recognition, conversational AI, and gamification. The goal is to help kids develop their language skills (speaking, listening, reading, and writing) in an engaging, fun, and adaptive environment.

## Project Overview

This game leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Speech Recognition** technologies to create an interactive and personalized learning experience. It uses **GPT-3/4** for conversational AI, **Google Speech-to-Text** and **Text-to-Speech** for voice interaction, and a **game engine** (Unity or Godot) for building the user interface and game mechanics.

The game adapts to a child's progress, adjusting difficulty levels and providing real-time feedback to enhance the learning process.

## Features

- **Conversational AI**: Interact with the child using natural language through GPT-based AI.
- **Speech Recognition**: Convert spoken input into text using Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure Speech-to-Text.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Convert AI responses into speech to create a fully interactive experience.
- **Adaptive Learning**: Adjust game difficulty based on the child's progress and provide personalized learning paths.
- **Gamification**: Include mini-games, rewards, and challenges to keep children engaged.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Give immediate feedback through animations, sounds, and encouragement.

## Technologies Used

- **NLP**: GPT-3/4 (via OpenAI API), Hugging Face Transformers
- **Speech Recognition**: Google Speech-to-Text API, Microsoft Azure Speech Service
- **Text-to-Speech**: Google Cloud Text-to-Speech, Amazon Polly
- **Game Development**: Unity (C#), Godot (GDScript)
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow (for adaptive learning algorithms)
- **Game Design**: Unity or Godot (for game interface and interactions)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following:

- **Unity** or **Godot** game engine installed.
- **Python 3.7+** and **pip** installed for backend services.
- **Google Cloud API Key** or **Microsoft Azure Speech API Key** for speech recognition and synthesis.
- **OpenAI API Key** for GPT-3/4 API access.

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-Language-Learning-Game.git
   cd AI-Language-Learning-Game
   ```

2. **Set up Unity or Godot**:
   - Download and install Unity (or Godot, if preferred).
   - Open the project in Unity or Godot based on your choice.

3. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up API keys**:
   - For Speech Recognition, follow the instructions in the `speech_recognition` folder to set up Google Cloud or Azure.
   - For Text-to-Speech, follow the setup instructions in the `text_to_speech` folder.
   - For Conversational AI, sign up for OpenAI and set up API keys in the `conversational_ai` folder.

5. **Run the game**:
   After setting up everything, you can run the game within Unity or Godot. The backend services (speech and conversational AI) will be running in parallel via Python.

## Development Plan

### Phase 1: Planning and Research (2 Weeks)
- Define project scope, features, and target audience.
- Research technologies for NLP, speech recognition, and game development.

### Phase 2: Technical Setup & Prototyping (3 Weeks)
- Set up development tools and APIs.
- Develop basic prototypes for speech recognition, text-to-speech, and conversational AI.

### Phase 3: Core Development (4 Weeks)
- Implement conversational AI, adaptive learning, and gamification.
- Add game mechanics and integrate the learning system.

### Phase 4: Testing and Iteration (3 Weeks)
- Conduct internal and user testing, refine based on feedback.
- Fine-tune the AI and adjust game difficulty.

### Phase 5: Finalization and Deployment (2 Weeks)
- Perform final testing and bug fixes.
- Prepare deployment for app stores or web platforms.
